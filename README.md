### AR.js demos

Some simple working demos to understand how Jerome Ettiene's [AR.js](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js) works.

Due to the different technologies needed and its own evolution, all demos work with a determinate scripts you can find in the js folder.

Targets:
- For [basic.html](https://mangasmartin.github.io/ARjs_demos/basic.html) demo you need to use the [hiro marker](https://jeromeetienne.github.io/AR.js/data/images/HIRO.jpg).
- For [custom_pattern.html](https://mangasmartin.github.io/ARjs_demos/custom_pattern.html) demo you can use the [custom marker](assets/custom.png) locates on the assets folder. As is explained in the AR.js repository, you can create your own marker and its patt file here: [](https://jeromeetienne.github.io/AR.js/three.js/examples/marker-training/examples/generator.html)
